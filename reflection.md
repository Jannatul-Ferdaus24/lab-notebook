## Reflection Document

### HTML

1. I completed my execise on my own and used some resources like- W3schools website, some youtube videos.

2. Exercises were particularly helpful. I have a comprehensive understanding of HTML foundations after doing and connecting all of this lab homework. The first exercise of html section covers ordered and unordered lists.I learned how to embed and describe images by completing Exercise 2, Images.The next exercise, "Tables," shows how to organize and present tabular data. From Exercise 4 on Forms is useful for understanding user input collection and form controls. So this homework helps me to understand how html codes work properly.

3. In my opinion everything explained properly.

4. Tasks focused on using semantic HTML tags <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, etc are helpful for me.

### Accessibility

About accessibility I would recommand some points -

1. Give each image a descriptive alt text.
2. For readability, to make sure the text and backdrop have an appropriate contrast ratio.
3. Use <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> as well as other semantic HTML tags when needed.

### Form

1. Lab homework give the opportunity to develop codes of each sections that we covered in our lecture. So I tried my best to utiize this therefore I did all the exercises by my own. But as supliments I used w3school website.

2. Creating a form is very useful since it combines several components (text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons) and provides an in-depth understanding of form development.

3. In my suggestion more example about form handling will helpful to clearify advanced level form development. Additionally, How to display and handle form errors.

4. The CSS part of form might have helped me because by applying CSS to style form elements, making them visually appealing and user-friendly helps to build perfect form interface.

### Accessibility

1. Make sure the form has the right labels and descriptions so that screen readers can understand it.

### CSS

1. I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but for certain parts, especially when trying to achieve very specific layouts or advanced flexbox properties, I referred to external resources like youtube videos and solutions for guidance such as w3school. These resources were particularly useful when I needed a clearer understanding of complex concepts or troubleshooting specific issues in my code.

2. I found the exercises in this section extremely helpful. They provided a hands-on approach to learning CSS, which reinforced my understanding of various properties and techniques such as using <justify-content>, <align-items>, <padding> etc.

3. One area that I felt could have been explained better is the concept of CSS specificity and how it impacts the application of styles. While the exercises did touch on this topic, a more in-depth explanation or additional examples would have been beneficial

4. Exercises focusing on responsive design principles and media queries would have been beneficial.

### Accessibility

1. Ensure that the layout adjusts properly on different screen sizes, including for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Use media queries to adapt the design for various devices.

2. Use semantic HTML elements to improve the accessibility and readability of the markup.

### Flexbox

1. I was able to complete many of the exercises on my own by applying my knowledge of Flexbox properties. However, for some of the more complex layouts and specific scenarios, I used w3school website.

2. I learned the measurement of the flexbox. Additionally, one particularly helpful exercise was creating complex layouts using Flexbox. This exercise required a deep understanding of how Flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction work together to achieve the desired layout.

3. While the exercises were comprehensive, I wish there had been more detailed explanations on the interactions between different Flexbox properties, especially when combined.

4. As I never used flexbox before so the whole lecture helped me a lot to know what flexbox is and how it works.

### Accessibility

1. cautious when using the order property to visually rearrange content.
2. Make the measurement set in mind.

### CSS grid

1. I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own by applying my knowledge of CSS Grid properties. However, I follow w3school and the lecture slides as a helper.

2. The exercises in this section were very helpful. They provided hands-on experience and reinforced my understanding of CSS Grid properties.
   The exercise on creating a layout with grid areas (Exercise 02) was particularly helpful. It provided a comprehensive overview of how grid areas can be defined and utilized to create complex layouts. This exercise was instrumental in solidifying my understanding of CSS Grid and its capabilities in structuring web content.

3. While the exercises were comprehensive, I wish there had been more detailed explanations on the interactions between different CSS Grid properties, especially when combining grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-template-areas.

4. Creating responsive layouts that adjust based on screen size and orientation.
   Combining CSS Grid with other layout techniques, such as Flexbox, for more complex and versatile designs.

### Accessibility

1. Ensure that the logical order of your HTML content matches the visual order. This is especially important when using the order property in CSS Grid.
2. Use grid template areas to create meaningful and understandable layouts.

### Bootstrap

1. Using my knowledge of Bootstrap's grid structure, components, and utility classes, I was able to do the majority of the exercises by myself.

2. Exercise 04, which focuses on constructing modals, was really beneficial. It gave a thorough rundown on how to make the most of Bootstrap's modal component, including styling and making sure it's accessible. My understanding of the JavaScript components of Bootstrap and how to incorporate them into a project has improved significantly as a result of this exercise.

3. Everything is cleared to me through the lecture and slides.

4. Creating a responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus.
   Building a fully responsive multi-column layout that adjusts based on screen size.

### Accessibility

1. Ensure modals are accessible by managing focus and using ARIA attributes.

### /javascript

1. I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own by applying my knowledge of JavaScript, including asynchronous programming and functional programming concepts.

2. The exercise on fetching data from an API (Exercise 06) was particularly helpful. It provided a comprehensive overview of how to use fetch and async/await to retrieve and display data. This exercise was instrumental in solidifying my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

3. I wish there had been more detailed explanations on error handling and edge cases when fetching data from APIs.

4.

### Accessibility

1. Use ARIA live regions to announce loading status.
2. Manage focus when new content is loaded to ensure it is accessible.

### jquery

1. I did by my on but I used w3school as a resource.

2. The exercises in this section were very helpful. They provided practical experience with key jQuery concepts such as selecting elements, event handling, and making AJAX requests.
   The exercise on making AJAX requests and displaying fetched data (Exercise 02) was particularly helpful. It provided a comprehensive overview of how to use jQuery's $.ajax method to retrieve and display data from an API. This exercise was instrumental in solidifying my understanding of asynchronous data fetching in jQuery.

3. Everything is clear. The lecture and slides are helpful.

4. Implementing form validation using jQuery and providing feedback to the user.

### Accessibility

1. Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) are accessible via keyboard. This includes managing focus properly when elements are added or removed from the DOM.
